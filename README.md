# Heart Disease Prediction ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∫

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models and provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit.

## Steps Covered

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized and understood patterns in health features using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
- **Data Processing & Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering & Extraction:** Created and transformed features to improve predictive power.
- **Modeling:** Implemented and compared multiple supervised learning models with Scikit-Learn, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Model Deployment:**
  - Saved trained models using **Joblib**.
  - Built an interactive **Streamlit frontend** to allow users to input health data and receive predictions in real-time.
